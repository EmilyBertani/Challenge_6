# Housing Rental Markets for Neighborhoods in the San Francisco Greater Area

---

## What this program does

In this program we have created the ability to view San Francisco housing rental data in multiple interactive plot forms, including bar charts, line graphs, and map overlays. We can review all data by neighborhood with widgets that allow us to use a drop down menu to select from each neighborhood. The goal is to determine if a one-click buy-and-rent stragegy is a worthy investment for San Francisco.
